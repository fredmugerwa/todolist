# Todo List Application
This Todo List application is built using JavaServer Faces (JSF) for the frontend, Java for the backend logic, and Hibernate as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework to handle data persistence. The app allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently by providing a user-friendly interface to create, update, and delete tasks. The use of JSF ensures a responsive and interactive UI, while Hibernate handles the seamless storage and retrieval of task data in a relational database.
